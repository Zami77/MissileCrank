## Description
Missile Crank is a Missile Command-inspired game where you destroy enemy ships before they crash into your cities!

You begin the game with 5 cities that each produce 20 points for you at the end of each level (as long as they stay alive!).

Destroying enemy ships will award you points and scraps, the amount depending on ship type.

Points count for your high score and scraps can be used to purchase upgrades in between levels.

You can upgrade Target Speed, Maximum Missile Capacity, and Missile Projectile Speed. All of which are imperative to help defend your cities

The levels get progressively more challenging, so defend your cities as long as you can and avoid Game Over!
